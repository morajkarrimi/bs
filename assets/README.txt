# Assets Directory

## Purpose
This directory is intended for storing all website assets such as images, logos, icons, and other media files.

## Recommended Organization

### Images
- Place all image files in this directory (.jpg, .png, .webp, etc.)
- Consider using optimized images to improve website performance
- Suggested image sizes:
  - Hero banner: 1920x800px
  - Service cards: 600x400px
  - Blog images: 600x400px
  - Team photos: 400x400px (square)

### Subdirectories (optional)
You might want to organize your assets into subdirectories like:
- `/assets/images/` - For all photos and graphics
- `/assets/icons/` - For individual icons
- `/assets/logos/` - For logo variations

## Image Optimization
For better website performance, consider optimizing your images before uploading them:
1. Compress images using tools like TinyPNG, ImageOptim, or Squoosh
2. Use modern formats like WebP when possible
3. Provide appropriate image dimensions (don't use 4000px images for 400px containers)

## Updating the Website
To use your images in the website:
1. Replace the placeholder URLs in the HTML files
2. For background images, update the CSS in styles.css
