## Optimization Tips

1. Compress your images before using them to improve loading times
   - Use tools like TinyPNG, Squoosh, or ImageOptim
   
2. Use modern image formats when possible
   - WebP offers better compression than JPEG or PNG
   - Include fallbacks for browsers that don't support WebP

3. Use descriptive filenames
   - E.g., "barber-cutting-hair.jpg" instead of "img1.jpg"

4. Add appropriate alt text in the HTML for accessibility
   - E.g., `<img src="barber.jpg" alt="Barber cutting client's hair">`
